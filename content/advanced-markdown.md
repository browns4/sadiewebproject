## My Major

I am majoring in Integrative Informatics with a focus in Environmental Science and Sustainability and I am also majoring in Community and Justice Studies.

####how I found my Majors
When I came into college I did not really know what I wanted to study I was kind of just taking a bunch of classes that sounded interesting to me. When I was in my sophomore year I looked at all the the classes I had taken and some of the other classes i might want to take in the future and I was happy to find out that most of those fit into the Integrative Informatics major I chose the ESS focus because I had taken an ESS class and found it to be really fun and something that I could see myself wanting to work with in the future. At the start of my Junior year i had planned on just minoring in Community and Justice Studies my mentality with going for the major thus far has been "if you want to take that classes do it" and if the major works out that's awesome, but mostly I just want to be taking classes that challenge me at the same time that they are interesting to me.
