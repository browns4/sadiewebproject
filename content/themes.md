### Mini Zine Project

When COVID-19 hit last spring and we all got sent home, I really started to miss my friends and miss seeing how creative everybody is. In high school I took a really fun Zine Making class. So I came up with a plan... I am started the "MiNi ZiNE PROJECT" as a way to re-connect and stay connected with friends through a  4.5  x 2 .5 inch  page in a mini zine. The zine is made out of a single sheet of printer paper and then folded into a booklet with a cover, six pages and a back-cover. My idea was I would fill one page of the in the booklet and then send it to another friend who would then send it along. Once the booklet has been sent to six different people so that all the pages are full it is sent back to me and published on here so that everyone who contributed can see what we have all put together. (and because I wanted mail...) your pages is yours and you can do whatever you would like to do on it. You can draw, paint, write, stamp, scribble, collage, etc! The idea is to just be creative in whatever you make and to stay connected!
