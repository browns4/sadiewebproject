### Mini Zine Project

When COVID-19 hit last spring and we all were sent home, I really started to miss my friends and miss seeing how creative everybody is. In high school, I took a really fun Zine Making class. So I came up with a plan... I started the "MiNi ZiNE PROJECT" as a way to re-connect and stay in touch with friends through a  4.5  x 2 .5 inch  page in a mini zine. The zine is made out of a single sheet of plain paper that is then folded into a booklet with a cover, six pages and a back-cover. My idea was that I would fill one page of the booklet and then send it to another friend who would then send it along. Once the booklet has been sent to six different people and all the pages were full, it would be sent back to me and be "published" on a website so that everyone who contributed could see what we had all put together (and because I getting mail is quite novel to me). The page you create is yours and you can do whatever you would like to do on it. You can draw, paint, write, stamp, scribble, collage, etc! The idea is to just be creative in whatever way you like and to stay connected!
