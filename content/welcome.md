Hey! Welcome to my web page, it's great to have you :)

My name is Sadie Brown, I am currently a junior attending Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. When I am not at school I am usually at home in Portland, Oregon.


I was born in Southern California, I grew up in the mountains of San Burnadino I was fascinated with snow and loved playing with my dogs and older sister. We moved down the mountain, into a house in Redlands. We moved for a couple reasons it was closer to work and school which also gave for more opportunities for activities outside of school. I played soccer for a little but then ended up joining the YMCA circus and found a passion for hanging upside down or flying through the air.


When I was in 6th grade my family moved to Portland, Oregon. I went to a very small high school which focused on community learning. I continued my love for circus through out middle school and into high school. In high school I also for a love for competitive swimming and an apperception for running cross country and attempts in pole vaulting.

Now I am in college studying Integrative Informatics with a focus in Environmental Science and Sustainability and Community and Justice studies. I am also on the Allegheny swimming and diving team which I have met a lot of really awesome people through!


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. empress-blog is designed to be a static site version of the amazing [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/)

1. empress-blog is designed for developers who know how to deploy a static site (folder of html files and assets) using something like S3 or even just on NGINX.

1. If you are slightly less tech savvy or if you want to manage your blog outside of just a set of files in a git repo we highly recommend signing up for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/pricing/)

### Quick Start

```bash
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install empress-blog empress-blog-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with empress-blog](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
