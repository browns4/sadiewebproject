###Hey! Welcome to my web page, it's great to have you :)

My name is Sadie Brown. I am currently a Junior attending Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. When I am not at school I am usually at home in Portland, Oregon.

I was born in Southern California. I grew up in the San Bernadino mountains in the Inland Empire. I was fascinated with snow and loved playing with my dogs and older sister. When I was 8, we moved down the mountain into a house in Redlands, California. We moved for a couple reasons. It was closer to work for my parents and closer to school for me and my sister, which also allowed for more opportunities for activities outside of school. I played soccer for a little but then ended up joining the YMCA Circus and found a passion for hanging upside down or flying through the air.

When I finished 6th grade, my family moved to Portland, Oregon. I went to a very small high school that focused on community learning. I continued my love for circus through out middle school and into high school. In high school I also developed a love for competitive swimming. I also tried my hand at running cross country and pole vaulting.

Now I am in college studying Integrative Informatics with a focus in Environmental Science and Sustainability and Community and Justice studies. I am also on the Allegheny Swimming and Diving team! I have gained a lot of really awesome friends through that network!
