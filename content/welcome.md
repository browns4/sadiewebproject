###Hey! Welcome to my web page, it's great to have you :)

My name is Sadie Brown, I am currently a junior attending Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. When I am not at school I am usually at home in Portland, Oregon.

I was born in Southern California, I grew up in the mountains of San Burnadino I was fascinated with snow and loved playing with my dogs and older sister. We moved down the mountain, into a house in Redlands. We moved for a couple reasons it was closer to work and school which also gave for more opportunities for activities outside of school. I played soccer for a little but then ended up joining the YMCA circus and found a passion for hanging upside down or flying through the air.

When I was in 6th grade my family moved to Portland, Oregon. I went to a very small high school which focused on community learning. I continued my love for circus through out middle school and into high school. In high school I also for a love for competitive swimming and an apperception for running cross country and attempts in pole vaulting.

Now I am in college studying Integrative Informatics with a focus in Environmental Science and Sustainability and Community and Justice studies. I am also on the Allegheny swimming and diving team which I have met a lot of really awesome people through!

Check around on my sight for a little bit more about me and my interests!
