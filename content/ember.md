###Swimming and Diving in College

When I went to college I was pretty sure that I wanted swim competitively. I had a desire to try my hand at dive as well although I had never even gone of a diving board before.

Currently I am a part of [The Allegheny Women's Swimming and Diving Team](https://alleghenygators.com/sports/womens-swimming-and-diving/roster) as both a swimmer and a diver.

My events are:
  - 50 free
  - 100 free
  - 100 butterfly
  - 100 back stoke
  - 1 meter diving
  - 3 meter diving
