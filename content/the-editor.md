## Working History

I have had the opportunity to do a lot of fun work throughout high school. My first job ever, like before babysitting, gardening or petsitting, was being a swim instructing. I really like this job because it was outside in the sun all summer. I worked at a community center that was only a few blocks away from my house so I was able to walk there. I think this was a really good first job because I learned a lot of communication skills as well as learning how have a real job and learning responsibilities that come a long with that such as time management and organization.

I continued working at the pool for a couple years in the summer but during the school I began teaching circus. Circus was a big interest of mine and I loved getting to be in the space more often. This job was very similar to swim instructing but it built me up a lot more. Teaching circus included coming up with my own lesson plan and working with adults which i found out required a very different teaching approach.

My first summer back after college I worked for Portland Juice Co. a local juicery and farmers market vendor. This job was very different than work I had done before, I think mostly because it was mostly retail. I did a little juicing and website development here and there but most of the job was talking with consumers, filling orders, and working markets. I did really enjoy this as a summer job and I think here I learned a little bit more about the interworking of a company.

My sophomore year and through now I have worked with the Civic Engagement department as a Davies Leader. As a Davies leader I work with with The United Way of Western Crawford County. Here I have learn a ton! I have learn a lot about the place and the people within Crawford County. Through this job i have worked a lot with community outreach, fundraising, organization, event planning, and a ton more.
