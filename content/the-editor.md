## The start
I have had the opportunity to do a lot of fun work throughout high school. My first job ever, like before babysitting, gardening or petsitting, was being a swim instructing. I really like this job because it was outside in the sun all summer. I worked at a community center that was only a few blocks away from my house so I was able to walk there. I think this was a really good first job because I learned a lot of communication skills as well as learning how have a real job and learning responsibilities that come a long with that such as time management and organization.

I continued working at the pool for a couple years in the summer but during the school I began teaching circus. Circus was a big interest of mine and I loved getting to be in the space more often. This job was very similar to swim instructing but it built me up a lot more. Teaching circus included coming up with my own lesson plan and working with adults which i found out required a very different teaching approach.

My first summer back after college I worked for Portland Juice Co. a local juicery and farmers market vendor. This job was very different than work I had done before





## Inserting images

Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:



`![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)`

![Rusume](/images/resume.jpg)
/images/resume.jpg

If you want to add images to your empress-blog app you can just drop them in the `/public` folder, which you should see if you are running this locally!

_**Important Note:** empress-blog does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files **before** adding them to your project._


## Making lists

Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use `*` or `-` or `+`. Like this:

1. Crack the eggs over a bowl
2. Whisk them together
3. Make an omelette

or

- Remember to buy milk
- Feed the cat
- Come up with idea for next story


## Adding quotes

When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use `>` at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.

> A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made

All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.
