## Working History

I had the opportunity to do a lot of fun work throughout my high school years. My first job ever, like before babysitting, gardening, or petsitting, was as swim instructor. I really liked this job because it was outside in the sun all summer. I worked at a community center that was only a few blocks away from my house so I was able to walk there. I think this was a really good first job because I learned a lot of communication skills. I also learned the importance of time management and organization in this job.

I continued working summers at the pool for a couple years and during the school year I began teaching circus. Circus was a big interest of mine and I loved getting to be in the gym as often as I could. This job was very similar to swim instructing but it taught me more and more everyday. Teaching circus included coming up with my own lesson plan and working with adults, which I found out required a very different teaching approach. It was very inspirational to see their hard work and motivation.

My first summer back after college, I worked for Portland Juice Company, a local juicery and farmers market vendor. This job was very different than work I had done before. I think mostly because it was retail focused. I learned to juice and developed a website for the Company but most of the job was talking with consumers, filling orders, and working at the farmers markets. I did really enjoy this as a summer job. I taught me a little bit more about the interworkings of a company.

My sophomore year and through my junior year of college, I have worked with the Civic Engagement Department as a Davies Leader. As a Davies Leader I work with with The United Way of Western Crawford County. I have learn a lot about the place and the people within Crawford County. Through this job, I have worked a lot with community outreach, fundraising, organization, event planning, and a ton more.
