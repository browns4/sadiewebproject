## Working History

I have had the opportunity to do a lot of fun work throughout high school. My first job ever, like before babysitting, gardening or petsitting, was as swim instructor. I really like this job because it was outside in the sun all summer. I worked at a community center that was only a few blocks away from my house so I was able to walk there. I think this was a really good first job because I learned a lot of communication skills as well as learning how have a real job and learning responsibilities that come a long with that such as time management and organization.

I continued working at the pool for a couple years in the summer but during the school year I began teaching circus. Circus was a big interest of mine and I loved getting to be in the space more often as I could. This job was very similar to swim instructing but it taught me more and more everyday. Teaching circus included coming up with my own lesson plan and working with adults which I found out required a very different teaching approach but was also very inspirational to see their hard work and motivation.

My first summer back after college I worked for Portland Juice Company, a local juicery and farmers market vendor. This job was very different than work I had done before, I think mostly because it was retail focused. I did a little juicing and website development here and there but most of the job was talking with consumers, filling orders, and working at the farmers markets. I did really enjoy this as a summer job and I think here I learned a little bit more about the interworking of a company.

My sophomore year and through my junior year, I have worked with the Civic Engagement department as a Davies Leader. As a Davies leader I work with with The United Way of Western Crawford County. Here I have learn a ton! I have learn a lot about the place and the people within Crawford County. Through this job I have worked a lot with community outreach, fundraising, organization, event planning, and a ton more.
