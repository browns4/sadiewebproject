### I Ran Away and Joined the Circus!

I started doing circus in 2008 at [The Great All America Youth Circus] (https://docircus.org/great-y-circus) in Southern California. There I did acts like teeterboard, pyramid bike, trapeze, lear, acro, multiline cradle and other goofy things!

When we moved to Oregon, I still wanted to pursue my love of circus. But I took me a little to find a group that I felt as close with. But then I found [The Circus Project](https://www.thecircusproject.org/). Here I was able to work with amazing people and even travel a little to Seattle and Chicago to preform which was incredible.

If you ever have the opportunity to swing around on a trapeze or flip upside-down please please do it. It might be a little scary but once you do it you will want to do it again!
