###I like to ride my bike!

In the summer of 2019 and in 2020 I went on some little bike tours!

## 2019: Oregon Coast Bike Tour
This tour left from my front door step in Portland, Oregon went up to Astoria down the coast and through the Tillamook Nation forest and back at home. I bike just over 300 miles over a week. This trip was magical!

## 2020: NW Washington State Bike Tour
This tour left from Anacortes Washington and spent our last day in Seattle but we took the long way there. We bike around 500 miles in a week and a half, saw amazing landscapes, got to tour the San Juan Islands, take 7 ferries, and meet amazing and the most generous people.

##Meadville Biking
I am lucky enough to get to have a bike on campus thanks to my diving coach for lending me one! I have found that I love biking in Meadville even though it is not quite as bike centered as the other places I am used to biking. But it gets me off campus and seeing the most beautiful places around campus most often I bike to woodcock damn or to tamarack lake  which are both about 15 mile rides that can be done with friends in under 2 hours.

Check out the route to Woodcock from Allegheny [The whole Damn ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/4067981613)
