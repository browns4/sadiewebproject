###I like to ride my bike!

In the summer of 2019 and in 2020 I went on some incredible bike tours!

## 2019: Oregon Coast Bike Tour
We left from my front door step in Portland, Oregon, and rode to Astoria, the northwestern most point of Oregon. Then we headed down the coast and through the Tillamook State Forest and the finished the 300 mile loop back home! We only got one flat tire! This trip was *EPIC!*

## 2020: NW Washington State Bike Tour
This tour began in Anacortes, Washington. The first few days we toured the San Juan Islands before ferrying back to the mainland and heading down the west coast. A little over half way in the city of Cosmopolis, we headed northeast towards Seattle. We biked just over 500 miles in a week and a half, saw amazing landscapes, took 7 ferries, and met the most amazing and generous people.

##Meadville Bike Riding
I am lucky enough to have a bike on campus. Thanks to my diving coach for lending it to me! I have found that I love biking in Meadville even though it is not quite as bike centered as the other places I am used to. But it gets me off campus and seeing the most beautiful places around Crawford County. Most often I bike to Woodcock dam or to Tamarack Lake, which are both about 15 mile rides that can be done with friends in under 2 hours.
